# Programming Problems and Solution

```Markdown
The programming language used to solve the problems here in this Journey is Java.

Java is the first langauge I learned while was starting college. I had a lot of fun using it and solving problems with it.

Though I am using different other languages now for different purposes and school stuff's, I am back at using Java again.

Now, I am challenging myself to become much better using this language to become a better problem solver.

### Problem

Chef has to travel to another place. For this, he can avail any one of two cab services.

- The first cab service charges `X` rupees.
- The second cab service charges `Y` rupees.

Chef wants to spend the minimum amount of money. Which cab service should Chef take?

### Input Format

- The first line will contain `T` - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers `X` and `Y` - the prices of first and second cab services respectively.

### Output Format

For each test case, output FIRST if the first cab service is cheaper, output SECOND if the second cab service is cheaper, output ANY if both cab services have the same price.

You may print each character of FIRST, SECOND and ANY in uppercase or lowercase (for example, any, aNy, Any will be considered identical).

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

### Sample

| Input     | Output  |
| :---------| :------ |
| 3         |         |
| 30 65     | FIRST   |
| 42 42     | ANY     |
| 90 50     | SECOND  |

### Explanation

```Markdown
Test case 1: The first cab service is cheaper than the second cab service.

Test case 2: Both the cab services have the same price.

Test case 3: The second cab service is cheaper than the first cab service.
```

### My Solution

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class CABS {

    static void check(int x, int y) {
        if (x == y)
            System.out.println("ANY");
        else if (x < y)
            System.out.println("FIRST");
        else
            System.out.println("SECOND");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = in.nextInt();
        while(t > 0) {
            int x = in.nextInt();
            int y = in.nextInt();
            check(x, y);
            t--;
        }
        in.close();
    }

### Problem

Chef's current rating is `X`, and he wants to improve it. It is generally recommended that a person with rating `X` should solve problems whose difficulty lies in the range [X, X + 200][X, X + 200], i.e, problems whose difficulty is at least `X` and at most X+200X + 200.

- You find out that Chef is currently solving problems with a difficulty of `Y`.

- Is Chef following the recommended practice or not?

### Input Format

For each test case, output on a new line YES if Chef is following the recommended practice style, and NO otherwise.

Each letter of the output may be printed in either lowercase or uppercase. For example, the strings YES, yEs, and Yes will be considered identical.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 4000

### Sample

| Input     | Output  |
| :---------| :------ |
| 5         |         |
| 1300 1500 | YES     |
| 1201 1402 | NO      |
| 300 4000  | NO      |
| 723 805   | YES     |
| 1330 512  | NO      |

### Explanation

```Markdown
Test case 1: Chef's current rating is 1300, so he should solve problems with difficulty lying in [1300,1500][1300,1500]. Since 1500 lies in [1300,1500][1300,1500], Chef is doing his practice in a recommended way :)

Test case 2: Chef's current rating is 1201, so he should solve problems with difficulty lying in [1201,1401][1201,1401]. Since 1402 does not lie in [1201,1401][1201,1401], Chef is not doing his practice in a recommended way :(

Test case 3: Chef's current rating is 300, so he should solve problems with difficulty lying in [300,500][300,500]. Since 4000 does not lie in [300,500][300,500], Chef is not doing his practice in a recommended way :(

Test case 4: Chef's current rating is 723, so he should solve problems with difficulty lying in [723,923][723,923]. Since 805 lies in [723,923][723,923], Chef is doing his practice in a recommended way :)

Test case 5: Chef's current rating is 1330, so he should solve problems with difficulty lying in [1330,1530][1330,1530]. Since 512 does not lie in [1330,1530][1330,1530], Chef is not doing his practice in a recommended way :(
```

### My Solution

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class ADVANCE {
    static void solve(int x, int y) {
        if (y >= x && y <= x + 200)
            System.out.println("YES");
        else
            System.out.println("NO");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x, y, t = in.nextInt();
        while (t > 0) {
            x = in.nextInt();
            y = in.nextInt();
            solve(x, y);
            t--;
        }
        in.close();

- Each test case contains of a single line consisting of single integer `X`.

### Output Format

For each test case, output the number of kilometers Chef travels through office trips in a week.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ X ≤ 10

### Sample

| Input | Output  |
| :-----| :------ |
| 4     |         |
| 1     | 10      |
| 3     | 30      |
| 7     | 70      |
| 10    | 100     |

### Explanation

```Markdown
Test case 1: The office is 1 km away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 2 kms in a day. In a week with 5 working days, Chef has to travel 2⋅5 = 102⋅5=10 kms in total.

Test case 2: The office is 3 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 6 kms in a day. In a week with 5 working days, Chef has to travel 6⋅5 = 306⋅5=30 kms in total.

Test case 3: The office is 7 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 14 kms in a day. In a week with 5 working days, Chef has to travel 14⋅5 = 7014⋅5=70 kms in total.

Test case 4: The office is 10 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 20 kms in a day. In a week with 5 working days, Chef has to travel 20⋅5 = 10020⋅5=100 kms in total.
```

### My Solution

```

### Problem

Ezio can manipulate at most `X` number of guards with the apple of eden.

Given that there are `Y` number of guards, predict if he can safely manipulate all of them.

### Input Format

- First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers `X` and `Y`.

### Output Format

For each test case, print YES if it is possible for Ezio to manipulate all the guards. Otherwise, print NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

### Sample

| Input | Output  |
| :-----| :------ |
| 3     |         |
| 5 7   | NO      |
| 6 6   | YES     |
| 9 1   | YES     |

### Explanation

```Markdown
Test Case 1: Ezio can manipulate at most 5 guards. Since there are 7 guards, he cannot manipulate all of them.

Test Case 2: Ezio can manipulate at most 6 guards. Since there are 6 guards, he can manipulate all of them.

Test Case 3: Ezio can manipulate at most 9 guards. Since there is only 1 guard, he can manipulate the guard.
```

### My Solution

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = in.nextInt();
        while (t > 0) {
        int x = in.nextInt();
        int y = in.nextInt();
        if (x >= y)

```

### Problem

Chef is struggling to pass a certain college course.

The test has a total of `N` question, each question carries `3` marks for a correct answer and `-1` for an incorrect answer. Chef is a risk-averse person so he decided to attempt all the questions. It is known that Chef got `X` questions correct and the rest of them incorrect. For Chef to pass the course he must score at least `P` marks.

Will Chef be able to pass the exam or not?

### Input Format

- First line will contain `T`, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.

- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers `N`, `X`, `P`.

### Output Format

For each test case output "PASS" if Chef passes the exam and "FAIL" if Chef fails the exam.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "pAas", "pass", "Pass" and "PASS" will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ X ≤ N
- 0 ≤ P ≤ 3 ⋅ N

### Sample

| Input | Output    |
| :------ | :------ |
| 3       |         |
| 5 2 3   | PASS    |
| 5 2 4   | FAIL    |
| 4 0 0   | FAIL    |

### Explanation

```Markdown
Test Case 1: Chef gets `2` questions correct giving him `6` marks and since he got `3` questions incorrect so he faces a penalty of `-3`. So Chef's final score is `3` and the passing marks are also `3`, so he passes the exam :)

Test Case 2: Chef's total marks are `3` and since the passing marks are `4`, Chef fails the test :(

Test Case 3: Chef got all the problems wrong and thus his total score is `-4`. Since the passing marks are `0`, Chef fails the exam :(
```

### My Solution

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class PASSORFAIL {

    static void exam(int n, int x, int p) {
        int penalty = x - n;
        int score = x * 3;

### Problem

There is a group of `N` friends who wish to enroll in a course together. The course has a maximum capacity of `M` students that can register for it. If there are `K` other students who have already enrolled in the course, determine if it will still be possible for all the `N` friends to do so or not.

### Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer `T` - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

- Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers `N`, `M` and `K` - the size of the friend group, the capacity of the course and the number of students already registered for the course.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ M ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ K ≤ M

### Sample 1

| Input     | Output |
| :-------- | :----- |
| 7         |        |
| 2 50 27   | Yes    |
| 5 40 38   | No     |
| 100 100 0 | Yes    |

### Explanation

```Markdown
Test Case 1: The 2 friends can enroll in the course as it has enough seats to accommodate them and the 27 other students at the same time..

Test Case 2: The course does not have enough seats to accommodate the 5 friends and the 38 other students at the same time.
```

### My Solution

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class COURSEREG {
    
    static void check(int n, int m, int k) {
        int size = n + k;
        if (size <= m)
            System.out.println("Yes");
        else
            System.out.println("No");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = in.nextInt();
        for (; t > 0; t--) {
            int n = in.nextInt();
            int m = in.nextInt();
            int k = in.nextInt();
            check(n, m, k);
        }
        in.close();
    }
}
